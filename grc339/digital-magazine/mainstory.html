                    <h2>Italy’s Sofia Rafaelli Claims Historic Gold Medals</h2>  
                    <p>
                        Italy’s 18-year-old Sofia Raffaeli captured both gold medals on offer as rhythmic gymnastics competition got underway on Wednesday (14 September), claiming top honors in the hoop and ball finals.
                        Raffaeli set the tone early in the hoop final, competing first and scoring a remarkable 34.850—an improvement of nearly 2.5 points from her qualifying mark. That score proved unbeatable, with Bulgaria’s Stiliana Nikolova finishing second with 33.400, 1.450 points behind. Germany’s Darja Varfolomeev earned the bronze with a 32.150.

                    <p>
                        The final marked a historic moment: Raffaeli became the first Italian to win an individual gold medal at the World Championships, while Varfolomeev’s bronze was the first ever for a unified Germany in this competition. 
                        Raffaeli followed up her historic performance with another gold in the ball final. This time competing last, she knew the score to beat was Varfolomeev’s 34.100. Rising to the occasion, Raffaeli delivered a 34.900 to claim her second title of the day. Varfolomeev settled for silver, while fellow Italian Milena Baldassarri took bronze with a score of 32.400.

                        Earlier in the day, two of the competition’s top contenders—Israel’s Daria Atamanov and Bulgaria’s Boryana Kaleyn—withdrew. The pair had finished first and second respectively in the all-around at the European Championships in June. While no official reason was given for Atamanov’s withdrawal, the Bulgarian Gymnastics Federation stated that Kaleyn pulled out due to a high fever.
                        Competition resumes Thursday (15 September) with qualifications and finals in clubs and ribbon. Friday will feature the group all-around finals, where the top three teams will earn qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. At the Porte de la Chapelle Arena, history was made as 20-year-old Sofia Raffaeli from Chiaravalle captured the bronze medal in the individual all-around final, becoming the first Italian gymnast ever to reach the Olympic podium in this discipline. Her achievement marked a significant milestone not only for her own career but also for Italian rhythmic gymnastics, which had previously enjoyed success only in the team events. Italy’s past Olympic medals in this sport included a silver in Athens 2004 and bronze medals in both London 2012 and Tokyo 2020, all earned in group competition. Raffaeli’s individual breakthrough signals a new era for the country in this highly competitive field.

                        The 2022 world champion came into the final with high expectations, having topped the qualification round with a strong 139.100 total. Yet, her start in the final was less than ideal. Early mistakes in her hoop routine (scoring 35.250) and a subdued performance with the ball (32.900) left her in fourth place at the halfway mark, trailing the front-runners and casting doubt over her chances of a podium finish. The pressure was immense, and with two apparatus still to go, Raffaeli needed to deliver near-perfect routines to remain in contention.
                        Rising to the occasion, Raffaeli produced a spectacular clubs routine, scoring 35.900—one of the highest marks of the day—which vaulted her back into the top three. It was a turning point in her performance, showcasing the resilience and composure that have become hallmarks of her competitive style. With the podium within reach, she closed her campaign with the ribbon, scoring a solid 32.250. Her final total of 136.300 secured her the bronze medal, etching her name in the record books and delivering a proud moment for Italian gymnastics.

                        The gold medal was claimed by Germany’s Darja Varfolomeev, who delivered a dominant performance across all apparatus to finish with a total of 142.850. Bulgaria’s Boryana Kaleyn earned the silver with 140.600, completing a fiercely contested final that featured many of the sport’s top stars. Italy’s Milena Baldassarri, another strong contender, concluded the competition in eighth place with a total of 129.700, contributing to a strong overall showing for the Italian team.
                        Raffaeli’s bronze not only marks a personal triumph but also symbolizes the growing strength of Italy’s rhythmic gymnastics program. Her success, achieved on one of the sport’s biggest stages, will undoubtedly inspire the next generation of gymnasts and reinforce Italy’s status as a rising power in the individual all-around discipline.
