                    <p><span class="caps">Gori</span> Shaved Ice began with a dream and a block of ice. In the sweltering summers of Los Angeles, Hideyoshi Ikesue, an immigrant from Japan, longed to bring a taste of home to the bustling city. Armed with nothing but a traditional hand-cranked ice shaver and family recipes passed down for generations, he set up a small street cart, offering delicate, snow-like kakigōri to those seeking relief from the heat.</p>
                    <p>What started as a humble pushcart soon became a beloved neighborhood staple. Over the years, Hideyoshi's dedication to perfecting the craft of Japanese shaved ice—soft as fresh snowfall, layered with house-made syrups and authentic toppings like sweet azuki beans, matcha cream, and hand-whipped mochi—turned <span class="caps">Gori</span> Shaved Ice into a family-owned treasure.</p> 
                    <p>Today, generations later, we continue his legacy, blending tradition with innovation while staying true to the art of Japanese kakigōri. Every bowl served at <span class="caps">Gori</span> is a tribute to Hideyoshi's passion, a celebration of family, and a reminder that even the simplest things—like a spoonful of perfectly shaved ice—can bring people together.</p>
